I've found Google Spreadsheets has `=QUERY` function which accepts SQL-like
query and can produce grouped results. This is especially useful form summary
tabes For example having following data on the spreadsheet:

```
A 10
B 5
A 5
C 1
```

Function `=QUERY(A1:B4,"select A, sum(B) group by A")` will produce:

```
A 15
B 5
C 1
```
