:konferencija:

I did not got a chance to participate in MCH2022 but they have published records
of presentations which are available [here](https://media.ccc.de/c/MCH2022). Below are some notes of presentations
I've watched.

## Signal: you were the chosen one!

Personal score: 3/5

Ideas how Signal could be better chat app.

- Signal is the best chat app for now.
- Protocol can be federated (and should be) but it is not by design.
- Signal does not want other client apps would be using their servers.
- Phone number required to register is a bad thing.
- Signal is a "product" so it is moving towards social network. Let's hope it
  won't go there.
- Other similar rants.
