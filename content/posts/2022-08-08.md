I did not got a chance to participate in MCH2022 but they have published records
of presentations which are available [here](https://media.ccc.de/c/MCH2022). Below are some notes of presentations
I've watched.

## Signal: you were the chosen one!

Personal score: 3/5

Ideas how Signal could be better chat app.

- Signal is the best chat app for now.
- Protocol can be federated (and should be) but it is not by design.
- Signal does not want other client apps would be using their servers.
- Phone number required to register is a bad thing.
- Signal is a "product" so it is moving towards social network. Let's hope it
  won't go there.
- Other similar rants.

##  Non-Euclidean Doom: what happens to a game when pi is not 3.14159â€¦

Personal score: 4/5

Just a fun talk and findings. Not much of real value.

- Doom created on 1993. Open sourced on 1997-1999. One of availabe forks:
  https://www.chocolate-doom.org/
- The original Doom had an incorrect pi value defined in cosntant added by
  author John Carmack. While it is just a 10th number - there were no issues and
  this mistake was not detected.
- Pi constant is used in various trigonometric calculations in video games.
- Speaker tries to fix and abuse the constant to other numbers and check what
  the end result is.
