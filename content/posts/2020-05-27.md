I was a blogger long time ago. I really liked to write small posts. Though with
time I've started feel more and more responsibile of the posts I wrote. Which
is good in one way as this feeling is supposed to increase the quality of
posts. But there is other side too - I had multiple unpublished posts which
were not good enough. I've spent time to write those but I was not happy enough
to publish them. Also some topics were not which I was interested into. But
which (I expected) my readers are interested.

Then I stopped writing. I wanted to start again and again - created a tumblr
blog, something else. But still haven't got enough time blog. Recently
I've started to use vimwiki for my personal notes. Vimwiki has a diary option
which fits perfectly to write down few sentences out of my head in the same
editor where I've just wrote code (and which is opened in my terminal all the
time). This works well.

I'm wondering if this Write Next application as an API so I could import or
export my writings and still collect badges :-) Let's see.
