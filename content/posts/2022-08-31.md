title: "TIL: Open URL in VIM"

:vim:

Move cursor on the URL and type `gx` to open the URL in browser.

The `gx` actually calls `open` or OS equivalent command for given resource (it
can be URL, image, other type of file). Then `open` command decides what to do
with the object, e.g. if it is URL - open it in a browser.

I often use VIM to format text, e.g. generate multiple URLs and wanted to open
all of them in a browser. This can be done via macro e.g. `qegxj` will record
macro `e` to run `gx` and go one line bellow. Then simply executing macro for
each line opens all urls e.g.: `100@e`.
