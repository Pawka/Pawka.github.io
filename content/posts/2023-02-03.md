:til: :youtube-dl:

`youtube-dl` usually easily detects which and how to download media content from
given URL. But if webpage contains embeded videos from Vimeo it might not work.
I'm not sure if this is an issue for any embeded video or just for restricted.
Because I needed to download some media from members-only area so I could watch
those on a plane but was struggling.

There is a workaround:

1. Open "Network" tab on "Developers Tools" in a browser.
2. Click video to play and pause it.
3. New network request will appear wich contains `.json?base64_init=1` in part
   of URL. This is the request we need.
4. Modify URL to replace the mentioned part to `.mpd`. For example:
   `https://site.com/something.json?base64_init=1&param=val` should become
   `https://site.com/something.mpd?param=val`
5. Use `youtube-dl <URL>` to download video where `<URL>` is modified URL.
