title: "TIL: Configure Pulseaudio to not switch output to hot-plugged devices"

## Motivation

I have Blue Yeti USB microphone which also has an audio output for monitoring.
I do not use the output but once pluged-in - Ubuntu recognize it as new sound
card and switch output to the microphone immediatelly. This drives me nuts
because I always need to switch back audio output manually to previous device.

## Pulseaudio config

Pulseaudio has a feature automatically switch to hot-plugged devices which is
enabled by default. All is needed - comment out this setting on the
configuration.

Find and remove or comment-out the following lines on `/etc/pulse/default.pa`
file:

```
### Use hot-plugged devices like Bluetooth or USB automatically (LP: #1702794)
.ifexists module-switch-on-connect.so
load-module module-switch-on-connect
.endif
``
