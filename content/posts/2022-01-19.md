:til: :git:

Today I needed to extract git history of particular subdirectory and move it to
a separate repository. Source repository here contains original code from which
we want to extract the history. Meanwhile target repo is new repository to which
we want to import the history.

Command below creates a branch named "kyria" on source repository with commits
from specific path only:

```
$ git subtree split --prefix=keyboards/kyria/pawka --branch=kyria
```

Keep in mind that files in the new branch are displayed as those were created at
the root of repository. Let's say if we had a file on source repo
`keyboards/kyria/pawka/config.h`. On the `kyria` branch it will be placed on the
root as `config.h` only (no `keyboards/kyria/pawka/` prefix). This is allows
treat a subdirectory as completely new repo if needed. But I needed to create a
new repo and place all files on specific path.

Let's create a new repo:
```
$ cd ~/
$ mkdir target_repo
$ cd target_repo
```


Command below must be executed on the new repository to import history from the
`kyria` branch to specific path. New repository must contain at least one commit
- make sure there is one.

```
$ git subtree add --preffix=qmk/keyboards/kyria/ ../source_repo kyria
```

This will clone all files from the `kyria` branch on `source_repo` to the
`qmk/keyboards/kyria/` path on the `target_repo`.

In this way I've successfully imported history of couple paths from the original
repository.
