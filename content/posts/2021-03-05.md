:cli: :bash:

To run cli tools there is `xargs`. But what if I want to run certain part of
bash script (a function) in parallel? One option is to extract function to a
separate file and feed it into `xargs`. Another way - make `xargs` to execute
the function:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

p() {
    echo "> $1"
}

main() {
    export -f p
    seq 10 | xargs -n 1 -I {} bash -c  "p {}"
}

main "@$"
```

Necesary line here is to export the function via `export -f <function_name>`.
Once function is exported to the scope, `xargs` can access it and execute call
to the function. The `p {}` part means value from `seq` command is provided to
function `p`. E.g. `p 10`.
