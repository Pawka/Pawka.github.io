:fosdem: :konferencija:

This is the second time I'm participating online conference and both times are
Fosdem. Below are my personal notes of Fosdem 2022. Some notes might not be
completed which I was planning to do later. But it is possible the later never
came. My personal scores are mostly based how much fun I've received from the
talk. These do not reflect quality of presentations. Simply I might be to stupid
to understand the content so I'd rate the talk as "not so much fun".

## Getting 1K Chess for the ZX81

Personal score: 2/5

Interesting approach to run old 1K Chess code in background and use Web interface
for it. Value of talk is the idea itself.

- 1K Chess goal: Make computer to play against human chess. And still fit into
  1K of memory.
- Emulator written in JavaScript. Because JS comes with nice debugging options:
  two debuggers from JS emulators.
- Replaced player actions to NOP so those could be injected from web interface.

## Let's Get Serial!

Kudos for LaTeX Beamer slides :-) History & present of Serial port.

Personal score: 3/5

- point-to-point, binary, async, half duplex or full-duplex.
- GND is used in data transfer as edge low signal.
- The "fat" serial port (25 pins) has enough room for two serial connections.
  One for low speed and one for higher speed.
- RJ45 (can be found on dedicated network equipment). Any pin can be used for
  anything.
- Data Rates (bps): from 75 to 115,200.
- On-Wire format: Start Bit, Vector, Parity Bit, Stop Bit(s).
- Low adoption cost, simple & easy to understand. High availability, a lot of
  software for it, easy to debug.
- chat comment: Does not require much from hardware: couple of wires (2-3) and
  easy software stack.
