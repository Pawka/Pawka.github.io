:fosdem: :konferencija:

This is the second time I'm participating online conference and both times are
Fosdem. Below are my personal notes of Fosdem 2022. Some notes might not be
completed which I was planning to do later. But it is possible the later never
came. My personal scores are mostly based how much fun I've received from the
talk. These do not reflect quality of presentations. Simply I might be to stupid
to understand the content so I'd rate the talk as "not so much fun".

## Getting 1K Chess for the ZX81

Personal score: 2/5

Interesting approach to run old 1K Chess code in background and use Web interface
for it. Value of talk is the idea itself.

- 1K Chess goal: Make computer to play against human chess. And still fit into
  1K of memory.
- Emulator written in JavaScript. Because JS comes with nice debugging options:
  two debuggers from JS emulators.
- Replaced player actions to NOP so those could be injected from web interface.

## Let's Get Serial!

Kudos for LaTeX Beamer slides :-) History & present of Serial port connection.

Personal score: 3/5

- point-to-point, binary, async, half duplex or full-duplex.
- GND is used in data transfer as edge low signal.
- The "fat" serial port (25 pins) has enough room for two serial connections.
  One for low speed and one for higher speed.
- RJ45 (can be found on dedicated network equipment). Any pin can be used for
  anything.
- Data Rates (bps): from 75 to 115,200.
- On-Wire format: Start Bit, Vector, Parity Bit, Stop Bit(s).
- Low adoption cost, simple & easy to understand. High availability, a lot of
  software for it, easy to debug.
- chat comment: Does not require much from hardware: couple of wires (2-3) and
  easy software stack.

## Five mysteries in Embedded Linux

Personal score: 4/5

Though topic is for embedded Linux these tips also work for packaging pretty
well. Main focus is on reproducible builds system and not reinventing the wheel
(e.g. updates system).

- "Do not tinker with powers you don not fully understand."
- Do not manually complie. There are many dependencies such as libraries,
  variables etc. Fragile, unreproducible build.
- Always use a build system what integrates all application stack.
- Golden image does not work well. Don't create images manually, use build
  system.
- Don't rely on package repositories (e.g. apt). Don't use packages from
  different distributions.
- Some HW devices requires manual steps to setup or solve some problems (e.g.
  entering commands manually). Automate if possible. Document, write down &
  maintain a list of MAC addresses to identify which devices are updated.
- Updates are difficult, can brick devices. Don't build your own update process
  - better pick existing solution: OStree, SWupdate, RAUC. E.g. time in embedded
  Linux might be out of sync.

## Lightning talks: Tracking your time with Timewarrior

Personal score: 4/5

I've tried to use Timewarrior a while ago but did not liked it too much.
Probably because I've tried to integrate it with Taskwarrior and results of
integration were not those which I wanted. It was nice to see demo by the
maintainer and I was convinced to try Timewarrior again.

## Go: Dissecting Slices, Maps and Channels in Go

Personal score: 3/5

Clear & slow pace presentation on fundamentals of slices, maps & channels
internals. Good if you are not aware of those & like data structures. Intro too
long.

## Go: Mastering Your Error Domain

Personal score: 4/5

I liked the Q&A part even more than content. Raising the personal score for
this.

- Slides from documentation.
- See how exitcode error is implemented.
- `resperr` for handling HTTP status code errors and user messages (two error
  interfaces).
- Use bitmaps to define "this error & that error" things.
- Tip for decorating errors - say something positive to avoid duplicated
  statements in error message. Just mention what app is doing: "opening url:
  (err)", "running subcommand: (err)".

## Go: Go further without wires

Personal score: 3/5

Great presenter, not too much content.

- TL;DR Tiny-Go supports wireless: TCP, HTTP, MQTT, UDP. On multiple types on
  devices.
- On embedded systems there might not be OS. Hence using default `net/http`
  packages might not be possible. Tiny-Go has drivers to solve that.
- I want drone.
