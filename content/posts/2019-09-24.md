:til: :tmux:

Tmux has a handy shortcut that copies the entire visible contents of a pane to
a paste buffer. Enter tmuxâ€™s Command mode with `<Prefix>:capture-pane`.
The contents of the pane will be in a paste buffer. You can then paste that
content into another pane or window by pressing `<Prefix>]`.
