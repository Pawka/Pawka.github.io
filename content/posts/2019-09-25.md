:tmux:

Inside any pane, press `<Prefix>!` and tmux will create a new window from your
pane, removing the original pane.

Now, to move the first window into a pane in the second window, press
`<Prefix>:` to enter Command mode, and type this:

```viml
:join-pane -s panes:1
```

or

```viml
:join-pane -s :1
```

You can use this technique to move panes around as well. If your first window
had two panes, you could specify the source pane like this:

```viml
:join-pane -s panes:1.1
```

The resize-pane command accepts the -Z option for zooming a pane. Best of all,
itâ€™s already mapped to `<Prefix>z`, and pressing it again restores the pane to
its original size.
