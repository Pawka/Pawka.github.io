Finally Fosdem is live again! Unfortunatelly there was no direct flight from
Vilnius, since Brussels Airlines have stopped direct flights until spring.
Anyway, Fosdem was great this year!

## [Building a CI pipeline with Dagger in Go](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/gocidagger/)

Personal score: 2/5

Speaker did a short intro what Dagger is and then tried to launch demo for 20
mins but failed. I've got the main idea what Dagger actually is but nothing
special from this talk.

- Dagger allows to write pipelines in any language (Golang in this case was an
  example).
- From examples these pippelines are mostly creating Docker containers and
  running them.
- Pipelines can run anywehere (including locally which is good thing).
- SDK is GraphQL API hence a client can be created for any language.
- [Magefile](https://magefile.org/) - library to implement Makefile-like files in Golang.

## [Debugging concurrency programs in Go](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/godebugconcurrency/)

Personal score: 4/5

- Debugging can be done via `fmt.Print`, `dlv`, `strace`.
- Use different colours for output from different goroutines.
- Print scheduling events `GODEBUG=schedtrace=5000 <binary>`.
- `dlv` - add breakpoints. Sending data to chan does not work yet.
- Use `pprof.Labels` and then `pprof.Do(ctx, labels, func() ...)`
- `(dlv) goroutines -l` will list goroutines.
- `(dlv) goroutines -l -with label page=/about` - list routines with label.
- Deadlocks happen and are difficult to debug. Golang captures deadlocks when
  whole application stops working but not when separate parts are locked (e.g.
  few goroutines out of multiple).
- Use conditional breakpoints!
