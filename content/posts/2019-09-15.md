[.editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) is almost defacto standard to store project configuration
settings such as indentation, encoding etc. It is supposed to be supported by
multiple editors (including VIM via plugins).
Settings in `.editorconfig` file will take a precedence over any settings in vim
configuration.
