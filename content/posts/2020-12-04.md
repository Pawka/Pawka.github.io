:til: :firefox: :chrome:

Any HTTP request performed by Friefox or Chrome can be copied as `CURL` command.
It is possible other browsers this supports too but I had a chance to test it
with those two.

1. Open "Network" tab on Developer tools or equivalent.
2. Load the page.
3. Right click on desired request and select "Copy > "Copy as CURL" or similar
   command.

This will give you `CURL` with parameters included. Can be useful to debug some
requests.
