Below are my personal notes of Fosdem 2021 talks I've watched. This page might
be updated with additional insights after I'll watch recordings. I've put
personal interest score for every talk which represents my subjective experience
but not necessary the quality of talk.

## [Emulation 101: How anyone can do it](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/emu101/)

Personal score: 4/5.

Interesting intro talk on writing emulators. Not many technical details, quite
abstract but nice to listen for. Good if you haven't wrote an emulator yet. Few
tips if you already wrote one.

- Each chip is a separate component on emulator (RAM, COM, Display, CPU).
- Treat your timers (framerate, CPU).
- Write Chip8 as first emulator. There are more CHIP8 emulators in the world
  than software written for CHIP8.
- Emulator dev should write a good display module. Not necessary to emulate it.
- Implement reusable memory modes (with features such as can write, read,
  enabled).
- Cycles correction (how many cycles operation should take on CPU).

## [The Ides of RISC V](The Ides of RISC-://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/riscv_ides/)

Personal score: 3/5.

Nothing deep actually but nice to listen.

- Short intro into vector operations in CISC vs RISC-V CPUs. Nice feature in
  RISC-V that it is possible to configure vector size while in CISC it is
  pre-defined.
- Launched program in RISC-V emulator (because there are no available boards yet
  so everybody is coding in emulators?). See [Spike](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim).
- Demonstrated very basics interactive debugging in the emulator. The
  breakpoints can be added at memory addresses but not at symbols.

## [Embedded Linux "from scratch" in 45 minutes  on Risc V](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/linux_from_scratch_on_risc_v/)

Personal score: 2/5.

Good pre-recorded demo with multiple tools. Would be a valuable resource if I'd
need to put Linux in some embedded device. But I've joined this talk out of
curiosity only so honestly it was a bit boring to watch.

## [Drones, Virtual Reality and Multiplayer NES Games  The fun you can have with Pion WebRTC!](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/gowebrtc/)

Personal score: 2/5.

[Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) is WebRTC implementation in Golang.
Presentation mostly contains a list of example projects built with Pion. It
reveals capabilities of WebRTC but still talk was just a bunch of examples. And
ended in 15 mins (that probably was a good part).

## [Calling Python from Go In Memory](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/gopython/)

Personal score: 3/5.

There be dragons. Use `cgo` to import `cpython`. Then do some magic and execute
Python code from Golang application. Crazy!


## [Building cross platform Go GUIs fast using Fyne](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/goguifyne/)

Personal score: 3/5.

Presentation about [Fyne](https://fyne.io) Golang library which is used to build
GUI interfaces. I would not call this talk very entertaining since part of the
talk was about new features added. But the library looks promising with lean API
and definitely going to play with it.

## [The State of Go](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/stateofgo/)

Personal score: 4/5.

- Reviewing new features of Go 1.15 and 1.16 since 1.14.
- `mod` enables excluding particular versions (e.g. due security flaws).
- More `vet` warnings.
- `embed.FS` for embedding static things into binary (really nice!) [URL](UR://tip.golang.org/pkg/embed/)].
- RISC-V, Apple Silicon support. Everything is faster on M1 except crypto
  mining.
- Generics in the future.

## [Desktop Linux management at Facebook](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/desktoplinuxmgmtatfacebook/)

Personal score: 3/5.

- Official support was for Windows and Mac. Linux was used by fans.
- Images can be personalized for different teams. E.g. for engineers and
  non-engineers different images can be prepared.
- Facebook picked Fedora for desktop Linux (though Ubuntu was more popular).
- PXE Network install. Though with working from home started to raise issues.
- Chef bootstrap. Using [go2chef](https://github.com/facebookincubator/go2chef)
  for bootstraping. Chef is idempotent. Engineers are able to overwrite Chef
  playbooks by themselves.
- Packages are rolled out gradually in case of faulty packages.
- Btrfs.
