:fosdem: :konferencija:

Fosdem 2021 was the first virtual/on-line conference I've participated. I
(thought) do not really like watching videos and participate in such virtual
events. But I must admit I really enjoyed the Fosdem this year. Yeah, there were
multiple technical issues, like low video quality (very few times), speakers
did not hear hearing questions from the moderators, speakers and moderators were
cut in the middle of sentence when answering questions (because time management
was automated), etc. But despite that it was great to watch pre-recorded
presentation and chat with the speaker or other participants in parallel in the
chatroom. Ask questions, comment, up-vote other questions, etc. It was nice
experience and much better than I've expected initially!

Below are my personal notes of Fosdem 2021 talks I've watched. This page might
be updated with additional insights after I'll watch recordings. I've put
personal interest score for every talk which represents my subjective experience
but not necessary the quality of talk.

## [Emulation 101: How anyone can do it](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/emu101/)

Personal score: 4/5.

Interesting intro talk on writing emulators. Not many technical details, quite
abstract but nice to listen for. Good if you haven't wrote an emulator yet. Few
tips if you already wrote one.

- Each chip is a separate component on emulator (RAM, COM, Display, CPU).
- Treat your timers (framerate, CPU).
- Write Chip8 as first emulator. There are more CHIP8 emulators in the world
  than software written for CHIP8.
- Emulator dev should write a good display module. Not necessary to emulate it.
- Implement reusable memory modes (with features such as can write, read,
  enabled).
- Cycles correction (how many cycles operation should take on CPU).


## [An emulator for my old system today and tomorrow](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/retro_emulation/)

Personal score: 4/5.

- Emulators used to preserve retro computing (e.g. in museums)
- Since technologies change emulators also needs to be adopted to new
  architectures. E.g. Apple migrated from Power PC to Intel, then to ARM after
  15 years. To solve this problem multiple stacked emulators can be used: run
  emulator to run other emulator to run the software. Each emulators can be
  developed separately. Another approach - run emulator in VM (e.g. Java). VM
  will be adopted to new architecture so emulator can remain the same.

## [The Ides of RISC V](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/riscv_ides/)

Personal score: 3/5.

Nothing deep actually but nice to listen.

- Short intro into vector operations in CISC vs RISC-V CPUs. Nice feature in
  RISC-V that it is possible to configure vector size while in CISC it is
  pre-defined.
- Launched program in RISC-V emulator (because there are no available boards yet
  so everybody is coding in emulators?). See [Spike](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim).
- Demonstrated very basics interactive debugging in the emulator. The
  breakpoints can be added at memory addresses but not at symbols.

## [Embedded Linux "from scratch" in 45 minutes  on Risc V](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/linux_from_scratch_on_risc_v/)

Personal score: 2/5.

Good pre-recorded demo with multiple tools. Would be a valuable resource if I'd
need to put Linux in some embedded device. But I've joined this talk out of
curiosity only so honestly it was a bit boring to watch.

## [Drones, Virtual Reality and Multiplayer NES Games  The fun you can have with Pion WebRTC!](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/gowebrtc/)

Personal score: 2/5.

[Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) is WebRTC implementation in Golang.
Presentation mostly contains a list of example projects built with Pion. It
reveals capabilities of WebRTC but still talk was just a bunch of examples. And
ended in 15 mins (that probably was a good part).

## [Calling Python from Go In Memory](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/gopython/)

Personal score: 3/5.

There be dragons. Use `cgo` to import `cpython`. Then do some magic and execute
Python code from Golang application. Crazy!

## [Building cross platform Go GUIs fast using Fyne](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/goguifyne/)

Personal score: 3/5.

Presentation about [Fyne](https://fyne.io) Golang library which is used to build
GUI interfaces. I would not call this talk very entertaining since part of the
talk was about new features added. But the library looks promising with lean API
and definitely going to play with it.

## [The State of Go](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/stateofgo/)

Personal score: 4/5.

- Reviewing new features of Go 1.15 and 1.16 since 1.14.
- `mod` enables excluding particular versions (e.g. due security flaws).
- More `vet` warnings.
- `embed.FS` for embedding static things into binary (really nice!) [URL](UR://tip.golang.org/pkg/embed/)].
- RISC-V, Apple Silicon support. Everything is faster on M1 except crypto
  mining.
- Generics in the future.

## [Desktop Linux management at Facebook](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/desktoplinuxmgmtatfacebook/)

Personal score: 3/5.

- Official support was for Windows and Mac. Linux was used by fans.
- Images can be personalized for different teams. E.g. for engineers and
  non-engineers different images can be prepared.
- Facebook picked Fedora for desktop Linux (though Ubuntu was more popular).
- PXE Network install. Though with working from home started to raise issues.
- Chef bootstrap. Using [go2chef](https://github.com/facebookincubator/go2chef)
  for bootstraping. Chef is idempotent. Engineers are able to overwrite Chef
  playbooks by themselves.
- Packages are rolled out gradually in case of faulty packages.
- Btrfs.

## [The Fuzion Language](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/fuzionlang/)

Personal score: 2/5.

Intro in the language. I've joined a bit late so haven't got too much excitement
from the talk. The author is seeking for help to work on the language/website.

## [Designing OpenWifi chip](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/fsr_openwifi_opensource_wifi_chip/)

Personal score: 4/5.

Folks are designing open source WiFi chip. As I understand the main purpose of
such chip is to provide hardware to scientists and those who wants to tinker
with and reduce the cost. The cost reduced from 3600 USD to 900. Could be 200
USD. This is not a chip for your laptop :-)

## [ZX Adventure: Writing a new game, for a 40 year old machine](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/retro_zx_adv/)

Personal score: 5/5.

Game [URL](https://github.com/MarquisdeGeek/zxadventure).

- Author took a game for a book which wanted to implement.
- Looked for a sample code.
- Required tools: cross-assembler. Emulator (debugger is a must). Data
  converters. Assembler (Pasmo).
- Emulator enabled print every register and other values to be printed during
  execution for every program counter value. Helped a lot.
- Game needed three routines:
    - Draw dot in X,Y.
    - Read the input (from keyboard or joystick).
    - Play sound at f Hz for t seconds.
- Optimization is not necessary only unless it is necessary.

## [Compiling to WebAssembly](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/webassembly/)

Personal score: 3/5.

Live coding session to compile Scheme into WebAssembly. And then write compiler
to compile scheme into WebAssembly. Sadly I'm not much into scheme.

## [25 languages in 25 days](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/25_languages_in_25_days/)

Personal score: 3/5.

- Intro into Advend of Code. Since it was a lightning talk so the half of time
  was spent on intro.
- Speaker picked 25 languages and shuffled randomly.
- Was familiar with functional paradigm so no big challenges there. But that
  would be a challenge in other case.
- Rust was the language he'd like to work more with.

## [Why your PC only has sixteen colors](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/retro_colors/)

Personal score: 5/5.

Nice explanation why there are 16 colors in PC.

- RGB gives 8 colors (three colors and their intersections). In this way RGB can
  be encoded in 3 bits. Adding an extra bit would double the colors to 16.
- Black `0000` and bright-black `1000` are the same colors.
- All rainbow colors are not available between these 16 colors. Orange was
  missing. Brown is Orange.
- `Bbbbffff` where `b` is background, `g` is foreground and `B` is Blink.

## [Challenges running Jitsi Meet at scale during the pandemic](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/jitsi_scaling/)

Personal score: 4/5.

- Running on AWS. ALB redirects to HAProxy. HAProxy forwards requests to
  different shards. Multiple regions.
- Tried to over provision during COVID but did not work.
- Incorrect file descriptor limits. Needed to increase (affected Nginx,
  Prosody - the Jabber/XMPP server). Then multiple other issues explained.
- When pandemic hit the load came from two countries: Italy and Spain.
- Community stepped up to help. Creating guides, infographics, etc.
- Every participant is sending video in three different resolutions. Video
  bridge decides which resolution to use. E.g. for viewing videos in tiled way -
  only medium/low resolution is received.

## [Advent of Code   Behind the Scenes](https://fosdem.org/2021/schedule/event/adventofcode/)

Personal score: 5/5.

- The very first AoC was planned for 70 users capacity. It hit over few
  thousands immediately.
- Currently running on AWS. Elastic scaling does not help much since the traffic
  does not increase gradually but hits at 00:00 and then disappears. Worked
  directly with AWS to solve this problem.
- Author starts preparing AoC problems ~April. ~4 months are spent on problems.
- Generate problem, write solver, write input generator, test, write prose in
  the end.
